"""MkDocs hooks — pull external content into the build.

The legacy content folders ``internal_docs/`` (guides, plans) and
``architecture/`` (design notes) live outside ``docs_dir``. Rather
than duplicate or move those files, they are registered as additional
``File`` objects during the ``on_files`` event. Content stays
authoritative at its original location; the site build sees it as if
it were under ``docs/``.

ADR 0079 phases these injections out: ``internal_docs`` leaves after
the P2 concepts consolidation, ``architecture`` after P3 — at which
point this hook disappears.

``docs/index.md`` and ``docs/changelog.md`` are thin
``pymdownx.snippets`` wrappers over ``README.md`` / ``CHANGELOG.md``,
so those two files are NOT registered here.
