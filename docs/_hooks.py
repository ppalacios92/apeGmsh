"""MkDocs hooks — pull external content into the build.

The legacy design-notes folder ``architecture/`` lives outside
``docs_dir``. Rather than duplicate or move those files, they are
registered as additional ``File`` objects during the ``on_files``
event. Content stays authoritative at its original location; the
site build sees it as if it were under ``docs/``.

ADR 0079 phases this injection out: ``internal_docs`` left after the
P2 concepts consolidation; ``architecture`` leaves after P3 — at
which point this hook disappears.

``docs/index.md`` and ``docs/changelog.md`` are thin
``pymdownx.snippets`` wrappers over ``README.md`` / ``CHANGELOG.md``,
so those two files are NOT registered here.
