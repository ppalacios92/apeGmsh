"""ResultsViewer event-loop dispatcher.

A single-source pipeline for the four primitives that drive what the
viewport paints:

* **STEP**  — push current step values to one or all diagrams
              (``Diagram.update_to_step(step_index)``).
* **DEFORM** — recompute deformed substrate points and call
              ``Diagram.sync_substrate_points(deformed_pts, scene)`` on
              one or all diagrams. Also mutates ``scene.grid.points``
              in place when the scope is "all" so substrate-bound
              actors follow.
* **GATE**  — run the composition gate: each actor's visibility is
              ``d.is_visible AND (no_active_comp OR id(d) in active_layers)``.
* **RENDER** — single coalesced ``plotter.render()``.

Every UI gesture / observer / shortcut funnels through
``Dispatcher.fire(event_kind, ...)`` which selects the right primitive
sequence from the event matrix. This is the only place those four
primitives may run.

Every dispatch fires through ``apeGmsh.viewers._log.log_action``
(category ``dispatch``). The session log file captures the full
sequence with timestamps + duration; bug reports attach the most
recent file and we replay every gesture.

primitive in between, then runs one full pump on exit. Use it during
