"""Single source of truth for mesh.viewer overlay visibility state.

Pre-PR5 mesh.viewer kept two independent stores for overlay
visibility: the outline tree's eye-icons (which read their own
``_active_load_patterns()`` snapshot off Qt widget state) and the
right-side tab panels' checkboxes (which read their own
``active_patterns()`` / ``active_kinds()`` off Qt widget state).
Both fanned into the same ``_rebuild_*_overlay`` methods on
mesh_viewer.  Alternating between the two surfaces caused the overlay
to flip to whichever surface fired last — documented at
``_mesh_outline_tree.py:96-104`` as a deliberate follow-up.

This module is that follow-up.  :class:`OverlayVisibilityModel` is a
plain-Python (no Qt) state object holding the canonical
``{load_patterns, constraint_kinds, mass_visible}`` triple.  Both
the outline tree and the tab panels read from and write to this
model; mesh_viewer subscribes to the model's ``on_changed`` callback
for the actual ``_rebuild_*`` calls.

Observer pattern, not Qt signals, so the model stays testable
without a ``QApplication``.  Idempotent setters (no-op when the
new value equals the current value) keep the observer chain quiet
when a write reflects state that was already set by the other
surface — preventing the round-trip oscillation that a naive MVC
would create.

class OverlayVisibilityModel:
    """Canonical state for mesh.viewer overlay visibility.

    Three fields:

    * ``load_patterns: frozenset[str]`` — names of load patterns
      currently rendered (LoadsTabPanel + Loads outline section).
    * ``constraint_kinds: frozenset[str]`` — kinds (e.g. ``"rigid_link"``,
      ``"node_to_surface"``) currently rendered.
    * ``mass_visible: bool`` — single flag for the mass overlay.

    Setters are idempotent: setting a value equal to the current one
    does NOT fire observers.  This is what breaks the
    outline-eye ↔ tab-checkbox oscillation: when the tab panel mirrors
    a state already set by the outline, the mirror write is a no-op
    and nobody re-renders.

    Observers receive zero arguments.  Subscribers read the model's
    public attributes for the new state (typically only one of the
    three fields changes per write, but observers don't need to know
    which one — ``_rebuild_*`` calls are cheap enough to refire all
    three on any change).
