Phase-4 build pipeline helpers.

The bridge's ``BuiltModel.emit`` orchestrates emission, but the
non-trivial work — dependency-sorted ordering, element fan-out across
physical groups, orientation-derived per-element ``vecxz`` fan-out,
and pattern / recorder ``pg=`` fan-out — lives here as pure helpers
so the orchestration in :mod:`apesees` stays small and readable.

The helpers in this module never import :mod:`openseespy`; they speak
only to the frozen :class:`Emitter` Protocol via the bridge-attached
tag resolver and element-nodes context (see
:mod:`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.tag_resolution`).

Three deferred contracts are resolved here:

  1. **Element fan-out** across a physical group's element ids and
     connectivity (the bridge writes the per-element node tags into the
     emitter's ``_current_element_nodes`` slot, allocates a per-element
     tag, and drives ``spec._emit`` once per element).

  2. **orientation-derived per-element vecxz fan-out** (ADR 0010):
     when a ``Linear`` / ``PDelta`` / ``Corotational`` GeomTransf is
     constructed with ``orientation=`` rather than an explicit
     ``vecxz=``, the bridge computes the local tangent for each
     element in the transform-bearing PGs, queries the orientation
     triad at the element midpoint, resolves the per-element
     ``vecxz`` via :func:`resolve_vecxz`, and emits one
     ``geomTransf`` line per distinct ``vecxz`` (within a ``1e-9``
     tolerance), reusing the same geomTransf tag for elements whose
     vecxz matches.

  3. **Pattern / recorder ``pg=`` fan-out** to per-node and per-element
     tags: the bridge resolves ``pg=`` records on :class:`Plain`
     patterns (loads + sps) and on Node / Element recorders into
     concrete tag lists before driving each primitive's ``_emit``.

    per-node DOF requirements are mutually incompatible.

    Root cause (verified against OpenSees ``FE_Element::setID``,
    ``SRC/analysis/fe_ele/FE_Element.cpp``): an element sizes its
    equation-map array ``myID`` to its OWN ``numDOF`` (e.g. a 4-node
    tetrahedron declares ``numDOF = 12``).  When one of its nodes
    carries MORE DOFs than the element expects — the canonical case is
    a shell node (``ndf=6``) shared with a solid element (``ndf=3``),
    produced by fragmenting a shell surface onto a solid volume so they
    share interface nodes — the cumulative DOF count overflows
    ``numDOF``, ``setID`` returns ``-3``, and the element's stiffness is
    assembled into the WRONG global equations.  The result is a silent
    equilibrium violation: the structure deflects plausibly but only a
    fraction of the applied load reaches the supports
    (``Σ reactions ≠ Σ loads``).  No constraint handler or rotation
    clamp can repair it — the assembly itself is corrupt.

    The check is conservative: it fires ONLY when two elements with
    DISJOINT ``ndf_ok`` sets (e.g. shell ``{6}`` vs solid ``{3}``)
    genuinely share a node — a configuration OpenSees can never
    assemble (whatever single ndf the shared node is given, one of the
    two elements mis-maps).  Element types absent from the capability
    registry resolve to ``ndf_ok = None`` and are skipped (treated as
    unconstrained), so the guard never raises a false positive; it also
    never flags multi-ndf elements (beams / trusses carry ``{3, 6}`` /
    ``{2, 3, 6}``, which intersect both solids and shells) — a beam
    sharing a node with a solid is therefore NOT caught here (a rarer,
    distinct mistake; out of scope for this shell-on-solid guard).  The
    correct idiom for a real shell-on-solid interface is SEPARATE
    coincident nodes (shell ``ndf=6`` + solid ``ndf=3``) tied by
    ``g.constraints.equal_dof`` / ``tie`` on the translational DOFs
    (plus a shell-edge rotation clamp for the line-hinge), never shared
    nodes — see ADR 0033 / 0046.

    Adaptive elements (the zeroLength family, ``ndf_ok == {1..6}``) accept
    any per-node ndf but OpenSees requires **both** ends of a
    ``zeroLength`` / ``twoNodeLink`` / ``CoupledZeroLength`` to carry the
    SAME ndf (``ZeroLength.cpp``: ``dofNd1 == dofNd2``; on mismatch
    ``setDomain`` bails and the element is **silently absent** — analysis
    proceeds with no spring).

    Inference omits adaptive-only nodes (a spring-to-ground node touched by
    no structural element falls to the ``ops.model`` envelope), so a spring
    whose structural end infers a value != envelope would silently emit
    mismatched ends. This guard catches that — and the symmetric case of a
    spring straddling two structural regions of differing ndf — at build
    time, naming the element and the fix.

    ADR 0049 — this is the correctness spine of the node-pair zeroLength
    form: routing the fan-out through :func:`expand_spec_to_elements` feeds
    a node-pair spec's two endpoints (one typically a decoupled ground sized

    the raw inferred map, a correct ``ops.ndf(ground, K != envelope)`` would
    fall to the envelope here and falsely raise.  ``ZeroLengthSection`` is

    Used by Phase SSI-2.A staged-analysis decks.  Stages emit in the
    order they appear in ``BuiltModel.stage_records``; each one emits:

    1. ``stage_open(name)`` — comment delimiter for deck readability.
    2. Stage's :class:`InitialStressRecord` instances — parameter
       declarations + step_hook_ramp procs + addToParameter calls.
    3. The analysis chain (constraints / numberer / system / test /
       algorithm / integrator / analysis directive) — emitted via
       each primitive's ``_emit``.
    4. ``analyze`` loop — hook-wrapped if any initial_stress
       registered a ramp.
    5. ``stage_close()`` — emits ``loadConst -time 0.0`` +
       ``wipeAnalysis`` + clears the dispatcher lists.

    Analysis-chain primitives stay on the bridge's ``_primitives``
    list (they need tags via the topological-order pass); the stage
    record holds *references* to them, not copies.  ``BuiltModel.emit``
    skips the global pre-element emit of chain primitives when stages
    are declared, so each stage's chain is the only one OpenSees sees
    at run time.

    Phase SSI-2.D adds stage-bound ``fix`` / ``mass`` / ``region`` /
    ``recorder`` pools (``fix_records``, ``mass_records``,
    ``region_records``, ``recorder_specs``).  PR-A ships the dataclass

    mass) and PR-C (region + recorder).  Existing construction sites
    that don't pass the new fields keep working via the ``()``
    defaults.

    Stage-bound constraint pool (``stage_constraint_records``) holds
    resolved :class:`~apeGmsh._kernel.records._constraints.ConstraintRecord`

    emit pass skips them and the per-stage emit hook (after regions,

    elements

        Units must match the model's stress unit.
    ramp_steps
        Number of analyze steps over which the factor ramps 0 → 1.0.

# Columnar element containers (ADR 0065 v2 / plan_emit_memory_columnar.md B1+B4)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY these exist: at LOH.1 scale (~6.7M hexes) the element fan-out and the
# element plan were the dominant emit-time RAM term (~4-6 GB). The old form
# built a Python ``list[tuple[int, tuple[int, ...]]]`` per fan-out and a
# ``list[tuple[int, tuple[int, ...], int]]`` per plan-spec, so every element
# cost one boxed ``(eid, conn)`` tuple plus one boxed connectivity ``tuple``
# holding ``npe`` boxed ``int`` objects (~54M boxed ints total). Worse, the
# fan-out result is memoised per snapshot (see :data:`_PG_FANOUT_CACHE`), so
# that boxed graph stayed *resident* for the whole emit.
#
# These two containers keep the RESIDENT form columnar (int64 arrays, straight
# from the FEMData group arrays which are already numpy) and box a row only
# TRANSIENTLY at iteration — the yielded ``(eid, conn_tuple[, tag])`` tuple is
# reclaimed the moment the consumer's loop body finishes with it. Every legacy
# consumer keeps working unchanged because the containers are duck-typed to the
# old list-of-tuples: iterating yields the same tuples in the same order, and
# ``__len__`` / ``__getitem__`` / ``bool`` behave like the old list.
#
# Byte-identity depends on ITERATION ORDER matching the old code exactly:
#   * fan-out order = groups in ``GroupResult`` order, elements in stored id
#     order within each group (the old ``for group in result: for eid, conn_row
#     in group`` walk). We concatenate per-group in that same order.
#   * mixed-npe groups: connectivity is an object-dtype array padded with -1.
#     We store a per-row true-width array so iteration slices each row to its
#     valid width and no -1 padding ever leaks into a yielded tuple — exactly
#     what the old ``tuple(int(n) for n in conn_row)`` produced (``conn_row``
#     there was already the un-padded per-type block row).

    ``timeSeries`` / ``geomTransf`` / ``beamIntegration`` / ``damping``
    declarations; the bracket's ``model`` re-issue purges all four
    registries, and there is no earlier position to hoist the element to.
    So the STAGED path re-declares them at bracket close, in the exact
    global emit order (the 5b scoped pass, then the transform fan-out).

    Deliberately NOT a property of the bracket itself (the ADR records
    the measured rejection): re-declaring a tag that was NOT purged
    hard-errors (``MapOfTaggedObjects::addComponent - ... similar tag
    exists``), and the in-process module purges nothing on a ``model``
    re-issue — so a self-healing bracket would collide on ``live`` (and
    on the emitted py deck, which runs under the same module) for
    exactly the M >= 2-bracket models it would exist to fix.  Callers
    invoke this ONLY after a bracket actually fired, and ONLY on an
    emitter whose runtime actually purges (``model_reissue_purges`` —
    the Tcl deck alone today).

    Identity is safe by measurement (probe set recorded in ADR 0099 S7):
    an already-bound ``pattern`` holds a private copy of its series, an
    already-constructed element holds construction-time copies of its
    ``CrdTransf`` / ``BeamIntegration``, and ``region -damp`` copies the
    damping into the elements at the region line — so a re-declaration
    (even a MUTATED one) leaves every already-integrated stage
    bit-identical, and future by-tag references resolve the replayed
    (identical) declarations.

    ``transform_log`` is the capture :func:`emit_transform_specs` filled
    on the first pass — the orientation fan-out ALLOCATES per-vecxz tags,
    so a re-run cannot reproduce it; a log of the emitted lines can.

    ----------
    spec
        The element typed primitive (carries ``pg=``).
    emitter
        Target emitter; the per-element node tags are pushed via
        :func:`set_element_nodes` before each ``spec._emit``.
    fem
        FEM snapshot the spec fans out over.
    tags
        Allocator — produces a fresh element tag for each fan-out instance.
    base_resolver
        The bridge's base tag resolver (callable). The fan-out installs
        an *element-specific* resolver on top of it when the element's
        transform requires orientation-driven per-element vecxz
        overrides.
    transf_tag_for_element
        Dict keyed ``(id(transf_spec), element_id)`` → per-element
        ``geomTransf`` tag. Filled by :func:`emit_transform_specs` for
        orientation-bearing transforms; ``None`` (or missing keys)
        means use the spec's own resolver path.
    tag_recorder
        Optional ``{fem_eid: ops_tag}`` dict the fan-out mutates as
        each element is emitted.  Used by downstream emit passes that
        need to look up the OpenSees element tag for a FEM element id

    will bracket mid-deck, the staged path must be able to re-declare
    these lines at bracket close — but the orientation fan-out ALLOCATES
    per-vecxz tags, so a re-run cannot reproduce them.  A non-None log
    captures one entry per emitted line, in emit order, for
    :func:`replay_builder_scoped_declarations` to re-drive verbatim.

    For non-orientation transforms (explicit ``vecxz=``), one line
    per spec using the spec's own allocated tag — that's the path
    :class:`Linear` / :class:`PDelta` / :class:`Corotational` already
    handle in their ``_emit``. When ``ndm == 2`` and such a transform
    has neither ``vecxz`` nor ``orientation``, the bare 2-D form
    ``geomTransf <Type> $tag`` is emitted here instead (the primitive
    ``_emit`` requires a ``vecxz`` and doesn't know ``ndm``).

    For orientation-bearing transforms, the bridge:

      1. Walks every element spec whose ``transf`` IS this transform.
      2. For each element in the spec's PG, computes the per-element
         vecxz via :func:`compute_vecxz_for_element`.
      3. Deduplicates across all elements: distinct vecxz keys produce
         distinct ``geomTransf`` tags. The first encountered vecxz
         reuses the spec's own allocated tag (so the spec's tag is
         never wasted); subsequent distinct vecxz get freshly-allocated
         transform tags.
      4. Emits one ``geomTransf`` line per distinct ``vecxz``.
      5. Returns a per-element override map so the element fan-out can
         install element-specific resolvers for elements whose transform
         vecxz is not the spec's "own" tag.

      provider at this ``ndm`` ((2,3) T3 · (2,4) Q4 · (2,6) T6 · (3,8) H8 ·
      (3,10) Tet10); a tet4, prism, or a *count-aliasing* cell (an 8-node
      serendipity quad8 surface in 3D, a 3-node line3 curve in 2D) has none.
      The etype is authoritative — node count alone would wave quad8 through
      as an "H8".
    * **Dimension coherence** — ``perm``/``permH`` (and ``thick``) must
      match the model ``ndm`` (the parser reads exactly ``ndm`` values).
    * **``-stab`` on Taylor–Hood** — parser-fatal (TH is inf-sup stable;
      ``-stab`` is refused on quadratic shapes).  Caught here with the pg
      name instead of a per-element parse error.
    * **Straight sides (D3)** — the Bézier providers assume an affine map;
      the fork checks every mid-edge node against its edge midpoint with a
      ``1e-6 * edge_length`` tolerance at ``setDomain`` and DEACTIVATES the
      element on violation — from openseespy that surfaces only as a
      cryptic ``analyze()`` failure.  Checked here (vectorized) with mesh

      (:func:`_ladruno_up_carrier_blocks`): every node of an equal-order
      shape, the vertex slots only of a Taylor–Hood shape.  LadrunoUP is the
      only u-p element class in the capability registry, so it is the only
      one walked; a stock ``quadUP`` / ``brickUP`` cannot reach emit at all
      (:func:`infer_node_ndf` refuses an unregistered class).
    * **Datum** — any single-point constraint on DOF ``ndm+1`` of a carrier
      node: a broker or stage-claimed ``fix`` / ``s.support`` whose 0/1 mask
      flags that slot, or a pattern ``sp`` whose 1-based DOF index is that
      slot.  All three make the DOF constrained, which is what removes the
      null space; ``fix`` alone would false-refuse the ``sp``-datum idiom.
    * **Exempt** — everything the caller does not mark ``enforce``: H5
      archival, and any deck that does not declare ``ops.analysis.Static()``.
      A sealed region is PHYSICALLY CORRECT under Transient (undrained
      loading: the storage term ``1/Q̄`` puts a nonzero diagonal on the p
      rows, so the sealed tangent is regular — that is what the fork's own
      Terzaghi lane runs), so refusing it there would be a false positive.

    Known limitation (not enforced): a datum contributed only by a
    stage-scoped ``s.support`` is counted for the whole model, though it holds
    the DOF only inside its own stage; and a pressure DOF grounded indirectly
    through ``equal_dof`` to a fixed one is not traced.

    storage solvers keep only the upper triangle, silently discard one
    coupling block at assembly, and return plausible-looking garbage

    """Fan out the broker's MP-constraint records onto ``emitter``.

    Per ADR 0022 INV-5 this pass runs between element emission and
    pattern emission in :meth:`BuiltModel.emit`.

    Ordering (INV-3 / dependency-driven):

    1. **Phantom-node pre-step** — :class:`NodeToSurfaceRecord` rows
       carry synthetic 6-DOF phantom nodes whose tags must exist in
       the OpenSees domain before any constraint references them.
       Emitted via ``emitter.node(tag, *xyz, ndf=6)`` — the standard
       OpenSees per-node ``-ndf`` override pattern.  Tags are
       de-duplicated across records (paranoid; the resolver does not
       collide, but the cost of the set check is negligible).
       ``ndm`` sizes the coordinate list — its default of 3 matches
       :func:`emit_transform_specs`, so a caller that omits it gets
       the historical 3-D line rather than a silently different deck.

    2. **Rigid links** — :meth:`fem.nodes.constraints.rigid_link_groups`
       yields ``(master, slaves)`` tuples covering ``rigid_beam`` /
       ``rigid_rod`` :class:`NodePairRecord` rows, the ``rigid_body``
       slaves on :class:`NodeGroupRecord`, and the phantom-side
       rigid-link rows on :class:`NodeToSurfaceRecord`.  Emitted as
       one ``emitter.rigidLink('beam'|'bar', master, slave)`` per
       slave; ``rigid_rod`` maps to ``"bar"`` per the OpenSees
       vocabulary.

    3. **Equal DOFs** — :meth:`fem.nodes.constraints.equal_dofs`
       yields :class:`NodePairRecord` rows for ``equal_dof`` plus the
       phantom→slave equal-DOF rows nested under
       :class:`NodeToSurfaceRecord`.  Emitted as one
       ``emitter.equalDOF(master, slave, *dofs)`` per record.

    4. **Rigid diaphragms** — :meth:`fem.nodes.constraints.rigid_diaphragms`
       yields ``(perp_dir, master, slaves)`` for
       :class:`NodeGroupRecord` rows with kind ``rigid_diaphragm``.
       Emitted as one ``emitter.rigidDiaphragm(perp_dir, master,
       *slaves)`` per record.

    5. **Kinematic couplings** — :class:`NodeGroupRecord` rows with
       kind ``kinematic_coupling`` are emitted as one ``equalDOF``
       per ``(master, slave)`` pair (the per-DOF selectivity makes
       ``rigidLink`` / ``rigidDiaphragm`` wrong for this family —
       see the docstring on :meth:`rigid_link_groups`).

    6. **Surface couplings** — :meth:`fem.elements.constraints.interpolations`
       yields :class:`InterpolationRecord` rows (one slave node ↔ N
       weighted master nodes from a master element face).  Emitted as
       one ``emitter.embeddedNode(ele_tag, cnode, *args)``
       per record using a freshly allocated element tag.  Covers
       ``tie`` / ``distributing`` / ``embedded`` directly and
       ``tied_contact`` / ``mortar`` via the
       :meth:`SurfaceCouplingRecord.slave_records` expansion that
       ``interpolations()`` performs internally.

    Each constraint with a non-empty ``name`` is preceded by
    ``emitter.mp_constraint_comment(name)`` so the user's declaration
    label round-trips into emitted Tcl / Py via the ``# {name}`` line
    (INV-2).

    ``fem_eid_to_ops_tag`` is the bridge-built ``{fem_eid: ops_tag}``
    map — a :class:`CouplingControl` carrying a ``host`` element (the
    ``-k auto`` / ``-wcap`` scalers) stores it as a **FEM eid** and the
    coupling emitters translate it to the emitted OpenSees element tag
    here. Hosted controls fail loud without the map.

    No-op when the FEM snapshot exposes no ``nodes.constraints`` or
    ``elements.constraints`` accessors — broker constraints are
    purely additive on top of any other bridge state.

    construction*: the pair's nodes are co-located, so a cut hugging
    the interface replicates both onto both ranks and the tally is
    undecidable — the backing element is the locality information the

    Two loud preconditions make the pick exact rather than heuristic

      ``_extract_partitions`` replicates multi-partition boundary-entity
      elements across every partition holding the entity; a stamped
      element that turns out replicated (or absent) is a resolver-
      contract violation and refuses with the record, the element and
      the partitions holding it.
    * **Master node native to the owner.** The backing element lives on
      the owner rank, and an element's nodes are in its partition's
      node set by ``extract_partitions`` construction — asserted anyway,
      loudly, so a drift in extraction semantics cannot silently ghost
      the master.

    The ghost set is the record's real slave node when the owner does
    not natively own it (the foreign beam/slave node of ADR 0093 INV-5,

    2-D-ONLY by construction (``_interface_resolver._PHANTOM_NDF = 2``),
    so before this parameter existed EVERY mixed-ndf interface phantom
    went out as ``node <tag> x y 0.0 -ndf <n>`` and the ``-ndf`` was

    **INV-1 (the whole point of the verb):** ``iNode`` is the real

    is ``x_hat . (u_j - u_i)`` (fork ``ZeroLength.cpp:1991-2009``) and
    local-x is the master face's outward normal, so separation elongates
    and an ENT normal law carries zero force. Swapping the two endpoints
    converges just fine — as a tension-only interface. The golden tests
    pin the node order literally for exactly that reason.

    Materials go out through the typed S2/S1 primitives' own ``_emit``
    (they need no tag resolution, so this is byte-identical to a
    user-declared material and inherits every sign / range guard); the
    ``zeroLength`` line is hand-built like :func:`emit_contacts` rather
    than routed through the :class:`ZeroLength` primitive, because that
    primitive's ``_emit`` reads its endpoints from the emitter's
    element-nodes context and resolves material tags through the
    bridge's primitive-identity resolver — neither exists for records.

    Records claimed by ``s.interface(name=)`` (ADR 0093 S7) are SKIPPED
    here — their ``id(...)`` is in ``claimed_ids`` and they emit inside
    their owning stage's block via :func:`emit_stage_interfaces`.  They
    are still VALIDATED here, so a bad record fails loud before any
    line is written regardless of which pass owns its emit.

    Flat-path only: the partitioned path plans ownership per record

    """Emit ``node(tag, *xyz, ndf=6)`` for every phantom node.

    Phantoms only exist on :class:`NodeToSurfaceRecord` rows — the
    resolver synthesizes them at resolve time and stores their tags +
    coords on the record without writing them into ``fem.nodes`` (see
    pre-flight audit in the Phase 7b spec).  De-duplicates tags across
    records — paranoid-cheap; the resolver maintains a single counter,
    but the set check is one line.

    The H5 emitter's phantom-vs-real-broker discriminator is the
    stateless :func:`is_phantom_node` predicate, pre-loaded on the
    emitter by :func:`emit_mp_constraints` before this helper runs
    (S2 / ADR 0033 — real broker nodes can also pass ``ndf=K`` now,
    so the explicit predicate replaces the old "``ndf is not None``"
    heuristic).  No flag flipping needed here.

    **2-D.** The phantom takes ``ndm`` coordinates like every other
    node line — one rule, no exception (:func:`node_coords_as_floats`).
    The consequence is deliberate and worth naming: under ``ndm == 2``
    the ``-ndf 6`` now actually *lands* instead of being swallowed by
    the parser's optional-argument scan, so a 2-D ``node_to_surface``
    stops silently giving its phantom the model envelope and starts
    failing at ``RigidBeam``'s dof-mismatch check.  That construct —
    a 6-DOF master rigid-linked to a surface, ``equalDOF``-ing three
    *translations* — never had a 2-D reading; it only looked like it
    did.  Refusing it by model dimension is a resolve-time gate and
    belongs with the other dimension gates, not in the node emitter,
    which owes the deck exactly what the records say.

    """Build the emit-time resolver for ``stiffness="auto"`` tie records.

    ``K = AUTO_STIFFNESS_ALPHA · E_host · L_char`` where ``E_host`` is
    the largest ``E`` modulus among the materials of the declared
    element specs whose PG touches the record's master nodes, and
    ``L_char`` is the largest pairwise distance among those master
    nodes (the host face / sub-tet size).  apeGmsh never assembles
    stiffness matrices, so this deliberately estimates the host
    diagonal scale from material + geometry rather than reading
    ``max|K(i,i)|`` the way the fork's C++ ``k="auto"`` does.

    Returns a ``resolver(rec) -> float`` that raises
    :class:`BridgeError` when no E-carrying material can be found for a
    record's master nodes — an auto tie with no derivable host modulus
    must fail loud, not guess.

    The node→E and node→xyz maps are built lazily on the first record
    resolved, so handing a resolver to an emit pass that encounters no
    ``"auto"`` record costs nothing.

    **This is a CONDITIONING control, not a rigidity setting** (fork PR
    #839 §3.3).  ``AUTO_STIFFNESS_ALPHA = 1e3`` pins K to the host's own
    order of magnitude — exactly the regime where the residual constraint
    gap is largest — and it **cannot hold a rigid footing**: the fork
    measures the penalty gap as ``err = c/K_t`` exactly, so an auto-scaled
    tie lands around ``1e-4…1e-3`` of the push and stays there.  For a
    genuinely rigid tie use ``enforce="al"`` at a **moderate** ``K_t``
    plus the held-load augmentation sweep
    (:meth:`LiveOpsEmitter.augment`), which drives the gap to the solver
    floor instead.  Cranking ``k`` up is the wrong lever twice over:
    conditioning degrades linearly in ``K_t`` while the rigidity error
    stops improving, and a hand-set numeric ``k`` above ``1e6 × k_host``
    now draws a once-only fork warning whenever a ``-host`` is named.

    :meth:`from_plan` is the only place in the emit pipeline where an
    element's ops tags and its typed spec (element class + ``plane_type``
    + material) are both in hand, and the recorder fan-out — the consumer

    1. Collect every constraint that touches this rank — meaning any
       node it references lives on this rank (or, for embedded-node /
       ASDEmbeddedNodeElement, the host element lives on this rank).
    2. Compute the set of foreign nodes referenced by those
       constraints (nodes not in this rank's owner set, plus phantoms).
    3. Emit the foreign-node declarations FIRST (INV-2): regular
       foreign nodes via ``node(tag, *xyz[, -ndf K])`` — per-node ndf
       taken from the **global inferred map** (ADR 0048,
       :func:`infer_node_ndf`), falling back to ``foreign_node_ndf``
       (the ``ops.model`` envelope) for nodes the map doesn't cover.
       Because the inferred map is global + deterministic, a ghost node
       resolves to the SAME ndf its owner rank emits — cross-rank
       consistency without per-rank broker state.  Phantoms via
       ``node(tag, *xyz, ndf=6)``.  Each ghost also carries its owner's
       SP lines replayed from ``ghost_sp_ops`` — omitting them leaves a
       free, massless DOF on this rank and makes the global matrix
       singular; see :func:`_emit_foreign_node_declarations`.
    4. Emit the constraints in the same order as the unpartitioned
       :func:`emit_mp_constraints` (phantom-node pre-step → rigidLink
       → equalDOF → rigidDiaphragm → kinematic_coupling →
       ASDEmbeddedNodeElement) so cross-rank text is byte-identical
       per INV-1.
