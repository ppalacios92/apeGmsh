# ADR 0033 — S2: Wire per-node `ndf` into OpenSees emit paths

**Status:** Accepted (2026-05-24). Ships in branch
`feat/s2-ndf-emit-wiring` (PR TBD-S2-PR). Extends
[ADR 0032](0032-explicit-only-per-node-ndf.md) (the S1 broker contract
this consumer wires). Related to
[ADR 0021](0021-lineage-chain-replaces-snapshot-id.md),

[ADR 0019](0019-opensees-model-read-side-broker.md), and
[ADR 0026](0026-h5modelreader-protocol-contract.md).

## Context

[ADR 0032](0032-explicit-only-per-node-ndf.md) codified the per-node
`ndf` user contract: explicit declarations via `g.node_ndf.set(...)`
and `g.node_ndf.set_default(...)`, fail-loud `fem.nodes.ndf_for(nid)`
on undeclared nodes. The broker stored the data; the OpenSees emit
layer ignored it. Every `ops.node(...)` call passed the bridge's
model-wide envelope `OpenSeesModel.ndf`, regardless of what the user
declared per-region. Mixed-ndf models (shell on solid: shell nodes
need `ndf=6` for rotational DOFs; solid-only nodes need only `ndf=3`)
were correct in apeGmsh's broker but wrong in the emitted OpenSees
deck. S2 closes that gap without breaking any of the ~285 existing
`apeSees(fem)` test sites and example notebooks that declare a single
envelope `ndf` and expect every node to inherit it.

## Decision

**Override-only semantics.** `g.node_ndf` is the override channel;
the OpenSees model envelope (`apeSees(fem).model(ndm, ndf=K)`) is the
default. The emitter passes `-ndf K` to `ops.node(...)` only when the
broker has a non-sentinel value at that nid; sentinel slots emit
without `-ndf` and OpenSees applies the envelope. This mirrors
OpenSees-native semantics — `model BasicBuilder -ndf K` sets the
per-node default; per-node `-ndf J` is the override.

**`ndf_for(nid)` stays fail-loud.** Per
[ADR 0032](0032-explicit-only-per-node-ndf.md)'s contract,
`fem.nodes.ndf_for(nid)` raises `LookupError` when the slot is
sentinel or `_ndf is None`. The emitter wraps the call in
`try/except LookupError`; on miss it emits without `-ndf`, letting
the envelope win. This keeps `NodeComposite` decoupled from
`OpenSeesModel` and preserves the absence-vs-declared distinction at
the broker boundary.

**Validator at three sites.** `apeSees.model()`,
`OpenSeesModel.from_compose_buffers()`, and `OpenSeesModel.from_h5()`
all assert `envelope >= max(non-sentinel _ndf)` via
`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.build.validate_envelope_covers_broker_ndf`.
On mismatch, raise `BridgeError` naming the offending node and the
fix (raise `ndf` in `apeSees(fem).model(...)`). Three sites because
`OpenSeesModel` materialises through three distinct paths (live
session via `apeSees(fem)`, compose-buffer publish, H5
deserialisation); each must guard against a downsized envelope
silently truncating per-node declarations.

**Phantom-node carveout.** Broker-synthetic phantom nodes (per
[ADR 0022](0022-mp-constraint-emission-fanout.md) INV-3 — emitted
before constraints under MP so the foreign-rank tag exists) are never
in `fem.nodes.ids` and never resolve through `g.node_ndf`. They
continue to emit with hardcoded `ndf=6`. The H5 emitter previously
used `ndf is not None` as the phantom-vs-real-node discriminator —
that signal is now ambiguous (real broker nodes legally carry `ndf=`
under S2). The MP-constraint emit pass
(`emit_mp_constraints` / `emit_mp_constraints_partitioned` in
`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.build`) pre-loads the complete
phantom-tag set onto the emitter ONCE — before any node emission
begins — via
`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.tag_resolution.set_phantom_node_tags`.
The H5 emitter consults the predicate per call via
`is_phantom_node(emitter, tag)` to populate
`/opensees/constraints/phantom_node_tags`; other emitters ignore the
attribute. Phantom tags are guaranteed disjoint from real broker
tags (the resolver allocates `> max(broker_node_tag)`), so the
pre-loaded set classifies every subsequent node call unambiguously
and **without ordering constraints**. This is a broker-internal
exception to the explicit-only doctrine; the user never authors
phantom-node declarations.

Alternatives considered for the phantom discriminator:

- **Stateful mode flag** (`set_phantom_node_mode(emitter, bool)` —
  flip True before phantom-emit, False after) — rejected. The
  stateful shape is order-dependent and requires `try/finally`
  scaffolding in every phantom-emit call site; the stateless
  predicate-set replaces it with zero ordering constraints.
- **Tag-formula `is_phantom(tag)` predicate via `> max(broker_tag)`** —
  rejected as a coupling concern. The "tags > max" property is an
  *implementation detail* of the resolver's allocator; a downstream
  consumer asserting it would silently break if the allocator ever
  changes (e.g., reserved-range scheme, hash-based tagging). The
  explicit set carries the authoritative phantom enumeration and is
  cheap to compute (one walk of `NodeToSurfaceRecord.phantom_nodes`).
- **`is_phantom=True` kwarg on `Emitter.node()`** — rejected as a
  Protocol-widening cost not warranted by the use case. Only the H5
  emitter cares about the classification; the other four backends
  would all ignore the kwarg. The attribute-based bridge contract
  matches the existing `set_tag_resolver` / `set_element_nodes` /
  `set_current_fem_element_id` side-channels.

**OpenSeesMP consistency is hash-guaranteed.** Per
[ADR 0021](0021-lineage-chain-replaces-snapshot-id.md), the resolved
`_ndf` array folds into `fem_hash`. Every rank deserialises the same
broker, so all ranks agree on per-node `ndf` for shared nodes
without explicit cross-rank communication.

**`from_msh` carries `_ndf=None`** (revert of PR #321's zero-stamping).
Combined with `_hash_nodes` skipping the fold when `_ndf is None` OR
all-sentinel, hash symmetry is preserved across construction paths
AND the emit layer's envelope fallback works on `.msh`-loaded models.

## Consequences

**Zero user-facing migration cost.** Existing scripts that never
touched `g.node_ndf` emit byte-identical OpenSees decks — sentinel
slots elide `-ndf`, envelope is unchanged. The ~285 existing
`apeSees(fem)` test sites and every example notebook keep working
without any rewrite. Red team flagged this risk during design review;
the override-only resolution mirrors what
[ADR 0032](0032-explicit-only-per-node-ndf.md) §Consequences already
documented as the broker contract's downstream behaviour.

**Mixed-ndf shell-on-solid models now emit correctly** under both
single-process and OpenSeesMP paths. The four owned-node emit sites
in `apesees.py` (flat global, flat staged-owned, partitioned global,
partitioned staged-owned) and the foreign-node site in
`build.py::emit_mp_constraints_partitioned` all route through the
single helper `_emit_node_with_broker_ndf`. The
`OpenSeesModel.build('tcl'|'py'|'live'|'h5')` replay path widens its
per-node tuple to `(tag, coords, ndf|None)` so the per-node ndf
declarations survive an H5 round-trip without truncating to the
envelope.

**`OpenSeesModel.ndf` semantics shift** from "uniform per-node value"
to "envelope default for nodes without override." Existing accessors
(`.ndf` property) keep returning the envelope scalar — there is no
behavioural change for callers that already treat it as the model
default.

**Misconfigured envelopes fail at the call site, not deep in emit.**
A user who calls `apeSees(fem).model(ndf=3)` after declaring
`g.node_ndf.set("Shells", ndf=6)` sees `BridgeError` at the `model()`
call, naming the offending node and the fix. The same guard fires
again on `OpenSeesModel.from_h5(...)` and
`OpenSeesModel.from_compose_buffers(...)` so corrupted H5 files and
programmatic compose flows that bypass `apeSees.model()` also fail
loud.

**`_replay_into` consumes per-node ndf via tuple-widening (not via
broker lookup).** The helper at
`apeGmsh.opensees._internal.compose._replay_into` is a FEM-agnostic
free function that walks a typed-record graph; it does not (and
should not) take a `FEMData` parameter. The per-node tuple was
widened to `(tag, coords, ndf|None)` so the caller
(`OpenSeesModel._populate_emitter`, which holds `self._fem`) can
resolve `ndf_for(tag)` once and let the result travel with the node
record. `_replay_into` emits `-ndf K` only when the third tuple
element is non-`None`; legacy 2-tuple `(tag, coords)` callers are
tolerated for byte-stability of the existing replay shape.
