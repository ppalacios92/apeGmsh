"""Deform-follow contract guard — every rendering diagram implements
``sync_substrate_points``.

The contract (see :meth:`Diagram.sync_substrate_points`): post-ADR-0042
every diagram emits backend-owned dataset COPIES — extracted submeshes
included — so the base no-op pins a layer to the reference
configuration while the substrate warps. The viewer's DEFORM pump fans
out through this hook and through NOTHING else (the old
``_sync_layer_grids`` actor walk was dead code and is deleted).

This guard is the structural half of the enforcement (the behavioural
half is ``test_diagram_deform_follow.py``'s shift/reset contract): it
walks every ``Diagram`` subclass in ``apeGmsh.viewers.diagrams`` — the
package a diagram must live in to be registered — so a NEW diagram
that forgets the hook fails here at test time, not silently in a
user's deformed view. Mirrors the ADR 0056 state-contract guard
pattern (``test_viewer_state_contract.py``).

The contract is unconditional: every discovered diagram must override
the hook — no exemption mechanism exists (ADR 0058 S4 retired the last
exempt diagram, ``DeformedShapeDiagram``).
